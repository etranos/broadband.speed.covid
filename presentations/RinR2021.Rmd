# Introduction

## WFH / Telecommuting
- From a niche means of accessing work to a widespread way of life
- From $5$% to $47$% in the UK [@ons2020; @ons2020lm2019]
- $37$% WFM in European April $2020$ 
- $60$% in Finland  [@eurofound2020]
- Almost $50$% in the US, $37$% could be permanently moved online [@brynjolfsson2020covid; @NBERw26948]

## WFH / Telecommuting
- WFH = economic resilience during Covid-19

- Capability to WFH:
  - occupations
  - quality digital infrastructure

- Spatial clustering and dependence

## Digital divides
- 1st level: availability and quality of internet connectivity

- 2nd level: skills to effectively utilise digital technologies

- 3rd level: returns of internet usage

- Cross-level interactions

## Our approach
- Intersection of digital and material divides

- Economic resilience of places as digital technologies became an essential
tool of productivity during the pandemic
<br>
<br>
**internet services + occupations $\Rightarrow$ WFM $\Rightarrow$ economic resilience**

## Our approach
- UK Local Authorities Districts (LAD) as a case study
- Quality of internet service: *experienced* internet speeds during the spring $2020$ lockdown
- Time-series clustering to create clusters of local authorities with similar temporal signatures of internet speeds
  - $\Rightarrow$ 1st level of digital divide
- Regress cluster membership against their socioeconomic and geographic characteristics 
  - $\Rightarrow$ how the 1st level of digital divide intersects with the 2nd and 3rd
 
# Data

## Experienced Broadband Speeds 
- *Experienced* vs. advertised internet speeds
- $\Uparrow$ internet demand \ usage $\Downarrow$ experienced internet speed
- [www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk/](https://www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk/)
- @riddlesden2014broadband & @nardotto2015unbundling
- Stream data, anonymised individual speed tests
- Upload speeds and the frequency of speed tests March to May $2020$

## Experienced Broadband Speeds 
- An overall trend of increased testing from March to April and then a slight reduction from April to May in 2020, compared to less testing as Spring progresses in 2019

- $2019$ evening peak of testing, leisure activities, download speeds
- $2020$ **new morning peak** $\Rightarrow$ flatter hourly temporal profile

# Analysis

## Aggregation 
- Relatively scarce data to analyse as stream

- Composite week time series

- Mon-Friday, hourly $6:00$ -- $24:00$, excl. bank holidays

- $18$ hourly data points $x$ $5$ weekdays ($90$) for each local authority ($382$)

- Focus on upload speeds

## Time series clustering
- *Aim*: create clusters of local authorities with similar temporal signatures of internet speed

- Shape-based approach
- Match two separate time-series objects based on the similarity of their shapes 
- Distances between the shapes
- Simplicity: 
  - *k*-means
  - medoids, time-series objects with a minimal distance to all other cluster objects

## Time series clustering

<small>

- Cluster 1: Medium sized mostly rural cluster; slow mean upload speeds; high workday temporal variation.

- Cluster 2: Small rural cluster; highest mean upload speeds; slowdown more in evening.

- Cluster 3: Medium sized mixed cluster; fast mean upload speeds; medium temporal variation.

- Cluster 4: Rural reference LAD; medium mean upload speeds; high temporal variation.

- Cluster 5: Small suburban cluster; fast mean upload speeds; slowdown more in evening.

- **Cluster 6: Large mixed cluster; slowest aggregate mean upload speeds; low workday temporal variation.**

- Cluster 7: Small suburban cluster; fast mean upload speeds; medium temporal variation.

- Cluster 8: Small mainly suburban cluster; slow mean upload speeds; high workday temporal variation.

- **Cluster 9: Large, more urban cluster; fast mean upload speeds; lowest workday temporal variation.**

## Post-clustering regression analysis
- Explain the characteristics of clusters
- How the 1st level of the digital divide intersects with the 2nd and 3rd?
- Multinomial logit regression: cluster membership against:
<small>

  - population
  - pop. and job density
  - distance to nearest met. area and to London, South of the UK dummy
  - % of managerial, tech, skilled trade, professional, administrative, leisure, machine operation jobs
  - earnings, n. business est. per hab.
  - % furloughed pop., 2020
  - AM broadband tests per hab.
  - % of Virgin Media connections

## Cluster 6 

- Workers are more likely to hold managerial, tech and professional jobs
- Least likely to be furloughed
- Slow and less reliable speeds
- High job density

## Clusters 6 and 9

- Although speeds were slow and not as reliable during the morning peak as in cluster 9, the skills that enabled telecommuting
also enabled **greater returns** from doing so ($\Downarrow$ furloughed)

- LADs in cluster 9 were able to benefit both from reliable internet connections and populations
able to work from home to capitalise on their digital infrastructure

- But **lower returns** in the pandemic $\Rightarrow$ greater numbers furloughed

## Being on the right side of digital divides

- Clusters 3, 7 and 9 are on the right side of the 1st layer of digital divide

- Internet resilience supports, but also frustrates urban economies in different geographies: 
  - $\Uparrow$ morning peak tests per capita run in cluster 6

- Being on the right side of the 2nd level digital divide had a **greater impact on economic resilience** (3rd level digital divide), than having quality internet connectivity 
  - $\Rightarrow$ cluster 1 and 6

# Conclusions

---

- Seven of our nine clusters had slower upload speeds in the morning than in the evening

- Evidence of widespread telecommuting and other daytime internet use (e.g. education)
which changed the temporal profile of internet activity throughout the UK

- Upload speeds have not previously been seen as integral to universal service, considering there has never before been such extreme demand for telecommuting and operations such as video calls

---

- Τelecommuting from the viewpoint of the complex web of digital divides

- Quality of internet infrastructure

- Places may depend upon good internet reliability and connectivity to achieve economic resilience in a period like the current pandemic

- Νot every place hosts individuals with the necessary *skills* and in *occupations* to effectively use the internet to telecommute
